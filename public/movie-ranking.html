<h1>The Best Movies According to Francis</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Coming to America</h3>
<p>
    This is the first of it all. It contains so many people, and more importantly, Eddy Murphy.<br />
    I love it!<br />
</p>

<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>
    I love all the seasons of this movie. I don't have a favorite from amongst this.<br />
    Looking forward to seeing this transition into the next generation.<br />
</p>

<h3>Ghost</h3>
<p>
    I just love the mild horror scenes of this movie.<br />
    Looking forward to seeing scarier scenes<br />
